Digital Library Using Spring Boot
This project aims to develop a Digital Library Management System utilizing Spring Boot to facilitate efficient access to a vast collection of Books. The system provides an intuitive platform for users to browse, search, borrow, and return the books.
   features include:

   
•	Advanced Search and Filtering: Allows users to search by title, author, category, or keywords.

•	Borrowing and Return Management: Users can borrow digital resources and manage their borrow history.

•	A penalty system is integrated, where a fine is imposed if the borrowed book is not returned within 30 days. Penalties are calculated based on the delay duration, encouraging timely returns.

•	Admin Dashboard: For managing the library's inventory, including adding, updating, or removing resources.

•	RESTful APIs: Facilitates seamless integration with other educational platforms and mobile applications.


#Technologies used include Spring Boot for building the back-end API, JPA with  Hibernate for ORM.
